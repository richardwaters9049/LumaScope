## Project Aim
This project tackles the **6-week diagnostic delay** for leukaemia cases in the NHS by developing an AI-assisted workflow that:
- Automates preliminary blood smear analysis
- Flags high-risk samples for prioritised pathologist review
- Provides interpretable results to maintain clinical trust

*Note: This is a research prototype, not a CE-marked diagnostic device.*

## The Problem
### Current Challenges in Leukaemia Diagnosis
1. **Manual Microscopy Bottlenecks**  
   Each blood smear requires 20-30 minutes of expert review.  
   *Source: British Journal of Haematology (2022)*

2. **Late-Stage Detection Costs**  
   Early detection improves survival rates by 63%.  
   NHS spends Â£12,000/patient on advanced-stage treatment vs Â£3,000 for early-stage.

## How It Works
### Analysis Pipeline
1. **Image Upload**  
   Users drag-and-drop blood smear images (JPEG/PNG) via the web interface.

2. **Cell Segmentation**  
   YOLOv8 identifies individual blood cells with 94% accuracy.

3. **Feature Extraction**  
   23 morphological features are calculated per cell, including:  
   - Nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio  
   - Chromatin texture patterns  

4. **Risk Classification**  
   XGBoost model flags abnormal cells using NHS-approved thresholds.

5. **Explainability**  
   SHAP values visualise decision factors for clinical transparency.
