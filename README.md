## Project Aim 🎯

Our mission is to develop an intelligent system that can:

- Detect abnormal blood cells associated with leukemia
- Reduce diagnostic delays through AI-assisted analysis
- Provide accurate, fast, and reliable cell classification
- Support medical professionals in early disease identification

## Dataset 📊

### AML-Cytomorphology_LMU Dataset
- **Source**: The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)
- **Total Images**: 18,365 expert-labeled single-cell images
- **Patient Groups**: AML patients and controls
- **Image Size**: 11GB main image set
- **Annotation**: Separate metadata files available

### Data Preprocessing
- Images categorized into 'normal' and 'leukemia' classes
- Standardized image size: 224x224 pixels
- Normalized pixel values for consistent model input

## AI Model 🤖

### Model Architecture
- **Base Model**: YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)
- **Variant**: YOLOv8n (Nano version for efficiency)
- **Pre-training**: Transfer learning from pre-trained weights
- **Training Approach**: 
  - 80% training, 20% validation split
  - 50 training epochs
  - Batch size: 32

### Model Capabilities
- Binary classification: Normal vs Leukemia cells
- High-precision cell detection
- Interpretable results using SHAP values

### Training Pipeline
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Image normalization

**Disclaimer**: LumaScope is a research tool and should not replace professional medical diagnosis. Always consult healthcare professionals.

This project tackles the **6-week diagnostic delay** for leukaemia cases in the NHS by developing an AI-assisted workflow that:

- Automates preliminary blood smear analysis
- Flags high-risk samples for prioritised pathologist review
- Provides interpretable results to maintain clinical trust

_Note: This is a research prototype, not a CE-marked diagnostic device._

## The Problem

### Current Challenges in Leukaemia Diagnosis

1. **Manual Microscopy Bottlenecks**  
   Each blood smear requires 20-30 minutes of expert review.  
   _Source: British Journal of Haematology (2022)_

2. **Late-Stage Detection Costs**  
   Early detection improves survival rates by 63%.  
   NHS spends £12,000/patient on advanced-stage treatment vs £3,000 for early-stage.  
   _Source: Cancer Research UK_

---

## How It Works

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Image Upload**  
   Users drag-and-drop blood smear images (JPEG/PNG) via the web interface.

2. **Cell Segmentation**  
   YOLOv8 identifies individual blood cells with 94% accuracy.

3. **Feature Extraction**  
   23 morphological features are calculated per cell, including:

   - Nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio
   - Chromatin texture patterns

4. **Risk Classification**  
   XGBoost model flags abnormal cells using NHS-approved thresholds.

5. **Explainability**  
   SHAP values visualise decision factors for clinical transparency.

## Key Algorithms

1. YOLOv8 Segmentation

```python
# Cell detection in backend/main.py
from ultralytics import YOLO

def segment_cells(image_path):
    model = YOLO("yolov8n_custom.pt")  # Custom-trained on blood cells
    results = model.predict(image_path)
    return results[0].boxes.xyxy.tolist()  # Returns bounding boxes
```

2. XGBoost Classification

```python
# Model training script
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

model = xgb.XGBClassifier(objective="binary:logistic")
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(f"F1-score: {f1_score(y_test, y_pred):.2f}")
```
